The degrees of freedom for the F-distribution are determined as `df1 = n1 - 1` and `df2 = n2 - 1`, where `n1` and `n2` are the sample sizes. Finally, the p-value is calculated using the `scipy.stats.f.sf` function with the F-value, degrees of freedom, and `2` for the `loc` parameter to get the two-tailed p-value.
