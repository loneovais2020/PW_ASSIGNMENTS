    "1) Artificial Intelligence (AI): It is a branch of computer science that aims to create machines that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. An example of AI is an intelligent personal assistant like Apple's Siri or Amazon's Alexa that can understand and respond to voice commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Machine Learning (ML): It is a subset of AI that uses statistical techniques to enable machines to learn from data, without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning algorithms can automatically identify patterns in data and make predictions or decisions based on them. An example of ML is a spam filter that learns to recognize spam emails based on examples of both spam and non-spam emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Deep Learning (DL): It is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to enable machines to learn from large amounts of data. Deep learning algorithms can automatically extract features from data and learn complex representations of them. An example of DL is a system that can recognize objects in images, such as a self-driving car that can detect pedestrians, traffic signs, and other vehicles.\n",

The algorithm tries to learn the relationship between the input features and the output labels, and can then make predictions on new, unseen data.

Supervised learning uses labeled data, unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data, and semi-supervised learning uses both labeled and unlabeled data. Supervised learning is used for prediction or classification tasks, unsupervised learning is used for clustering or anomaly detection tasks, and semi-supervised learning is used when there is limited labeled data available."
