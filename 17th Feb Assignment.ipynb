    "Q1. MongoDB is a popular, open-source, NoSQL document-based database management system that stores data in a JSON-like format. It uses dynamic schemas, which means that documents in a collection can have different fields and structures. Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are databases that do not use the traditional relational database management system. They are designed to handle unstructured data, which can be challenging to manage in a traditional relational database system.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where:\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is unstructured or semi-structured.\n",
    "\n",
    "The application requires scalability and high performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is distributed across multiple servers or data centers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The application requires real-time analytics or real-time updates to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The application needs to handle large amounts of data with a high write-to-read ratio.\n"

    "\n",
    "Flexible Data Model: MongoDB stores data in a JSON-like format, which allows for flexible data modeling and supports the dynamic schemas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing: MongoDB supports secondary indexing, which helps in faster data retrieval and efficient querying.\n",
    "\n",
    "Replication: MongoDB supports replica sets, which allow for automatic data replication and high availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sharding: MongoDB supports sharding, which is a method of partitioning data across multiple servers, allowing for horizontal scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregation Framework: MongoDB includes a powerful aggregation framework that allows for advanced querying and data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "GridFS: MongoDB includes GridFS, which is a way of storing large binary files, such as images or videos, in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Native Support for Many Programming Languages: MongoDB has native support for many programming languages, including Python, Java, C++, and more."
