    "ANS:-   The filter method is a feature selection method that ranks features based on their individual importance to the target variable. Features are selected based on a statistical measure of their relevance, such as correlation, information gain, or chi-squared test. The filter method is a fast and unsupervised method that can be used with any machine learning algorithm.\n",

The best subset of features is the one that produces the best model. The wrapper method is a more computationally expensive method than the filter method, but it can produce better results.\n",
