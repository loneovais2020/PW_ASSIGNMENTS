    "App routing in Flask refers to the process of mapping URLs to the functions that will handle them. It is a way of defining how Flask should handle incoming requests from a client.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask uses a decorator called @app.route to define routes. This decorator is used to associate a URL with a function. When a client requests a URL that matches a route defined with this decorator, Flask will call the associated function to handle the request.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following code snippet:\n",
    "\n",
    "from flask import Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",

    "def hello_world():\n",
    "\n",
    "        return 'Hello, World!'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this code, we've defined a route for the root URL ('/') using the @app.route decorator. When a client requests the root URL, Flask will call the hello_world() function and return the string \"Hello, World!\" as a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use app routes in Flask for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "URL organization: By defining routes for different URLs, we can organize our application's URLs in a logical manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Separation of concerns: By mapping URLs to specific functions, we can separate the different concerns of our application into separate functions, making it easier to maintain and modify the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic routing: We can define routes with dynamic components, such as <int:id> or <string:name>, to create URLs that can accept variable values. This allows us to create more flexible and dynamic applications."
