    "Q1. Data encoding refers to the process of transforming categorical or qualitative data into numerical representations that can be easily understood and processed by machine learning algorithms. It involves assigning numerical values or codes to different categories or levels of a categorical variable. Data encoding is useful in data science because many machine learning algorithms require numerical inputs, and encoding allows us to represent categorical data in a format that can be effectively utilized for analysis and modeling.\n"

    "Q2. Nominal encoding, also known as label encoding, is a technique where each unique category or level of a categorical variable is assigned a unique numerical code. It does not impose any order or hierarchy among the categories. For example, suppose we have a categorical variable \"Color\" with three unique values: \"Red,\" \"Green,\" and \"Blue.\" Nominal encoding would assign the codes 0, 1, and 2 to these categories, respectively.\n",

    "In a real-world scenario, you could use nominal encoding for a dataset containing information about different car models. Suppose you have a categorical variable \"Brand\" with categories like \"Toyota,\" \"Honda,\" and \"Ford.\" You can apply nominal encoding to assign numerical codes (e.g., 0, 1, 2) to these brands, allowing you to represent the categorical variable numerically in your analysis.\n"

One-hot encoding represents each category as a binary vector where each unique value corresponds to a separate column. Each row has a 1 in the column corresponding to the category it belongs to and 0s in all other columns. This technique is commonly used when dealing with categorical variables with multiple levels or categories.\n",
