    "Q1. The difference between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding:\n",
    "- Label Encoding: Label Encoding is a process of assigning a unique numerical label to each categorical value in a feature. It simply replaces each category with a different number. For example, if we have a feature \"Color\" with categories \"red,\" \"green,\" and \"blue,\" label encoding would assign the labels 0, 1, and 2 to the respective categories. Label Encoding does not impose any order or relationship between the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ordinal Encoding: Ordinal Encoding is also used to encode categorical features, but it considers the order or rank of the categories. It assigns numerical labels based on the order of the categories. For example, if we have an ordinal feature \"Size\" with categories \"small,\" \"medium,\" and \"large,\" ordinal encoding might assign the labels 0, 1, and 2 respectively, indicating the relative order of the categories. Ordinal Encoding is suitable when there is a clear ranking or hierarchy among the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding:\n",
    "The choice between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding depends on the nature of the categorical variable and the underlying relationship among its categories. If the categories have a meaningful order or hierarchy, Ordinal Encoding should be preferred. However, if there is no inherent order or hierarchy among the categories, Label Encoding can be used.\n"

    "Q2. Target Guided Ordinal Encoding:\n",
    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique that takes into account the target variable while encoding categorical features. It assigns ordinal labels based on the relationship between the categories and the target variable. The labels are assigned in such a way that they capture the correlation between the category and the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "This encoding technique is useful when there is a strong relationship between the categorical variable and the target variable. It helps the model to learn the patterns and variations in the target variable more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a dataset with a categorical feature \"Education level\" (categories: High School, Bachelor's, Master's, Ph.D.) and a binary target variable indicating whether a person has a high income (1) or not (0). Target Guided Ordinal Encoding would assign labels to the education levels based on their correlation with the income level, such as 0, 1, 2, 3, indicating the increasing income potential associated with higher education levels.\n"

    "Q3. Covariance:\n",
    "Covariance is a statistical measure that quantifies the relationship between two variables. It indicates how changes in one variable are associated with changes in another variable. Covariance can be positive, negative, or zero, representing different types of relationships between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance is important in statistical analysis because it helps in understanding the direction and strength of the relationship between variables. It provides insights into whether two variables move together or in opposite directions. It is particularly useful in exploring associations and dependencies between variables, identifying patterns, and building models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance is calculated using the following formula:\n",
    "cov(X, Y) = Σ((X - μ_X) * (Y - μ_Y)) / (n - 1)\n",
    "where X and Y are the variables, μ_X and μ_Y are their respective means, and n is the number of observations.\n"
