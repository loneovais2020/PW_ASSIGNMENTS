    "Here are five functions of the pandas library with their execution:\n",
    "\n",
    "read_csv: This function is used to read a csv file and store its data in a pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Suppose we have a csv file named \"data.csv\" in the same directory as our script, then we can read its data into a DataFrame using the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",

    "df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')\n",
    "\n",

    "head: This function is used to display the first n rows of a DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: If we want to display the first 5 rows of a DataFrame named df, we can use the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "print(df.head(5))\n",
    "\n",

    "groupby: This function is used to group the data in a DataFrame based on some criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Suppose we have a DataFrame named df with columns \"gender\" and \"score\", and we want to group the data by gender and calculate the average score for each gender, we can use the following code:groupby: This function is used to group the data in a DataFrame based on some criteria.\n",

    "\n",
    "print(average_score_by_gender)\n",

    "merge: This function is used to merge two DataFrames based on a common column.\n",

    "Example: Suppose we have two DataFrames named df1 and df2 with a common column \"id\", and we want to merge them based on this column, we can use the following code:\n",

    "merged_df = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='id')\n",
    "\n",
    "print(merged_df)\n",
