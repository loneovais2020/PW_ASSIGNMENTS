    " In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating objects that defines the properties and methods that will be associated with those objects. An object is an instance of a class that has its own unique state and behavior, based on the definitions within the class. For example, we might define a class called \"Car\" that has properties like make, model, and color, as well as methods like start() and stop(). We can then create individual instances (object) of the Car class, such as a red Honda Civic or a blue Ford Mustang."

    "Encapsulation - the practice of keeping data and the methods that operate on that data together in a single unit (i.e. a class), and restricting access to that data and methods from outside that unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance - the ability of one class to inherit properties and methods from another class, allowing for code reuse and hierarchical relationships between classes.\n",

    "Polymorphism - the concept of objects of different classes being able to be used interchangeably, based on their shared behavior and interfaces.\n",
